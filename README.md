# Checks Job Offers at Block
Simple and basic python script checking if new positions have been added of removed from the career webpage at Block (Cash App, ...)
Right now, it can be run with 
`python scrub_diff.py`
You may want to adjust the url in th epython file to something more aligned with your profile.
The script always (except errors) write the most up to date list from the webpage as a pandas csv file. You can change that folder too, in the python file.

Cheers and good luck to you!

[] pip install 
[] pandas 2?
